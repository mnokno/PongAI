Pong AI - Reinforcement Learning Agent for Playing Pong

Welcome to the Pong AI project! In this exciting endeavor, we aim to create an intelligent agent capable of mastering the classic game of Pong through reinforcement learning. Our project consists of two main scenes: HumanVsAI and Training.

- ****HumanVsAI Scene****:
  In this scene, we have designed an environment where humans can test their Pong skills against our trained AI agent. It offers a user-friendly interface where players can interact with the game, controlling the paddle on one side while the AI controls the opposing paddle. This interactive environment allows users to gauge the AI's performance and witness its evolving strategies.
- ****Training Scene****:
  The Training scene serves as the core of our project, where we employ the power of reinforcement learning to train our Pong-playing agent. By using advanced techniques like deep policy gradients from unity [ml-agents package](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), we enable the agent to learn from its experiences and improve its gameplay over time. This iterative learning process allows the AI to optimize its decision-making and achieve higher scores through self-play and interaction with the environment.
